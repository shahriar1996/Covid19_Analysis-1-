## Datasets
The information about covid-19 and the datasets for this project can be found in [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control(ECDC)](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide).

## Summary of the project
In this project, the dataset is extracted directly from the original site without mannually downloading and uploading it in the project portfolio. As a result, whenever the code will run, it will run with the most updated data that were loaded. There is not much data cleaning needed for this dataset, however, depending on my analysis I get rid some columns. The main goal of this project is to visualize the spread of covid virus in the world and figure out which continent/country is affected more than others. This visualization would eventually lead some question about why/how some country is affected more than others and figure out the proper solution to reduce the virus spread.

**FYI, the site may change the structure of the dataset which can cause the code not to work**
